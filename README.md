The project attempts to visualize the many pictures I took over the semester of trees in NYC on my way to school while driving.
I used Node.js, express, p5.js, and html to create this project.  
After running nodemon in terminal you can go to an empty browser window and enter- localhost:3000 to run the program.  In order to stop the program just press a mouse key.
